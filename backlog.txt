Need to fix before release:

  Controllers:
  - Ability to view/update a task

  Views:
  - Friend Requests needs a lot touching up

Views:
  - Remove spacing when error has field on sign up page.
  - Viewing an odds are request needs touching up Style (sending the response)
  - Add event listener if there's a flash banner to hit escape to "x" out of it.
  - Sending a response with failures errors out
  - Lost odds are link in side bar
  - Completed odds ares, if empty, should display a message
  - Have mobile hamburger menu
  - Move notifications to profile view
  - "Round" the buttons/labels in the user-card-view
  - Request friend button should be updated to the new colorscheme
  - Inspect Black text vs. dark blue on the user cards
  - Collapse the sign-up page to fit on 13" page as one view
    - Maybe have First and Last name on the same row?
  - Log in page needs:
    - Sign up / forgot password as one row?
  - Lost odds ares in color of wining (green) and losing (red)
