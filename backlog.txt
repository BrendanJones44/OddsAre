Need to fix before release:

  Views:
  - Need to finalize notification -> feed migration. 
    Old notifications shouldn't appear,
    Odds ares should just appear as a link to the odds are (maybe some context?)

  - Lost odds are link in side bar
  
  Controllers:
  - Ability to view/update a task
  - Sending a response with failures errors out

Should fix (but not required before release):
  Views:
    - Remove spacing when error has field on sign up page.
  - Viewing an odds are request needs touching up Style (sending the response)
  - Completed odds ares, if empty, should display a message
  - Have mobile hamburger menu
  - Inspect Black text vs. dark blue on the user cards
  - Collapse the sign-up page to fit on 13" page as one view
    - Maybe have First and Last name on the same row?

Nice to have features:
  - Log in page needs:
    - Sign up / forgot password as one row?
  - Lost odds ares in color of wining (green) and losing (red)
  Other:
    - Add event listener if there's a flash banner to hit escape to "x" out of it.
    - Look into some of the rules silenced by rubocop
    - Add rule to rubocop to require controller methods to include a path and REST method
    - Add ReadME and documentation
    - Binding.pry capability
    - Order odds ares by date, show "time ago"
